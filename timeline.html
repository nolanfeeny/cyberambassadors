        <div><p>The CyberAmbassador project is proposed over a three-year timeline, ideally
beginning in November, 2017. Key milestones are outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>External Advisory Board.</strong> The Board will be established at the beginning of the project and ideally convene for the first time at SC17. Meetings will be scheduled at least twice per year to discuss curriculum development, program evaluation, and sustainability planning. Meetings will be co-located with CI conferences (SC, PERCE, etc.) and/or held virtually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Curriculum Development.</strong> The initial curriculum will be developed during 2017-18.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recruitment.</strong> CI-professionals will be recruited to participate in CyberAmbassadors training in the months prior to each of the workshops. It is anticipated that the CyberAmbassadors program will leverage existing recruitment activities and co-locate at times with other CI training events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Workshops.</strong> The 2-day CyberAmbassadors Workshop will be piloted in Summer 2018 at MSU and at least two other sites. In subsequent years, workshops will be hosted by interested institutions and include "train the trainer" opportunities; while training is listed during the summer months in Figure 3, other times will be accommodated as facilitators and host institutions are available. Each workshop is expected to serve 25 participants, with a total of 200+ trainees over this 3-year project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evaluation.</strong> At the conclusion of the pilot-testing summer, data gathered from the participants will be evaluated to assess and refine the curriculum. Additional data will be collected from subsequent trainings, and from surveys of participants after they have returned to their home institutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Curriculum Refinement.</strong> The curriculum will be reviewed and refined based on data gathered during the pilot testing and subsequent trainings; the final curriculum will be available by year 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Train the Trainers:</strong> The "train the trainers" events will start in the second year with initial recruitment from participants in the pilot programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dissemination.</strong> Dissemination is planned throughout the three years of the program. The curriculum and training materials developed as part of CyberAmbassadors program will be open-source to encourage replication or adaptation of this training model. Results of summative and formative studies will be submitted to appropriate journals and conferences, particularly the 2018-2020 Super Computing, PEARC and ASEE (the American Society for Engineering Education) conferences; and the Journals of Engineering Education and Science Education and Technology.</p>
</li>
