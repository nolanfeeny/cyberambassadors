<p>Cyberinfrastructure (CI) is transforming research in science and engineering by supporting new methods
for gathering, analyzing, modeling and simulating data. Many technical training programs exist to prepare
CI Professionals, who are experts in developing CI and applying computational tools and techniques.
Frequently, CI Professionals are asked to work with scientists and engineers who are not experts in CI but
wish to leverage advanced computation to enhance their research. In order to work effectively with these
disciplinary experts, CI Professionals need to be able to communicate across disciplines, work in diverse
teams, and serve as collaborative leaders and mentors. These "professional skills" are essential to bridging
the gap between CI Professionals and the science and engineering domain experts who want to use CI.</p>
<p>This proposal will provide technically-proficient CI Professionals with training in communications,
teamwork, and leadership, with the goal of developing "CyberAmbassadors" who are prepared to lead
multidisciplinary, computationally-intensive research at their home institutions. The proposed project has
the following objectives: <strong>(1) Develop Curriculum</strong> that focuses on professional skills (communications,
teamwork, leadership) within the context of large scale, multi-disciplinary computational research.
<strong>(2) Pilot, Evaluate and Revise</strong> the curriculum. Pilot trainings will be held at Michigan State University
(MSU), at appropriate CI conferences, and at other institutions and laboratories. During the pilot process,
approximately 75 individuals will be trained as CyberAmbassadors and the curriculum will be evaluated
and refined based on these experiences. <strong>(3) "Train the Trainers"</strong> by collaborating with external partners
(XSEDE, Blue Waters, Software/Data Carpentry, Tau Beta Pi) to prepare a cohort of at least 20
facilitators who can offer the CyberAmbassadors training through regional or national events. 100-150
additional participants will complete the CyberAmbassadors program during the "train the trainers"
process. The curriculum developed as part of this project will be offered on a free, open-source basis.</p>
<h3>Intellectual Merit</h3>
<p>This project is proposed by a group with expertise in computational science, engineering, and the design
and evaluation of curricula, and leverages existing partnerships between MSU, CI resource and training
organizations (XSEDE, Blue Waters, Software/Data Carpentry) and Tau Beta Pi (TBP), the Engineering
Honor Society. The curriculum will be developed with input from an External Advisory Board of CI
Professionals and CI Users from academia, industry and national laboratories. The pedagogical approach
is grounded in constructivism and socioculturism, and will combine in-person training with examples
from real, multi-disciplinary research. The primary audience for this training is CI Professionals, who
already have technical expertise in CI; they will be trained in the professional skills essential to serve as
CyberAmbassadors, who are prepared to support and lead multi-disciplinary CI projects.</p>
<h3>Broader Impacts</h3>
<p>This proposal will train CyberAmbassadors from different social, cultural, geographic and disciplinary
backgrounds and prepare them to support and lead multi-disciplinary CI research at their home
institutions. CyberAmbassadors will also be prepared to help mentor the next generation of CI
Professionals and CI Users, who will become a sustaining source of new CyberAmbassadors. The "train
the trainers" component of this proposal is a collaboration with groups that provide technical training for
hundreds of CI Professionals and CI Users each year, and with TBP, which supports a national network of
volunteers who facilitate professional development seminars for approximately 3,000 students and
professionals annually. By partnering with these organizations, MSU will be able to sustainably "train the
trainers" and achieve the longer-term goal of making the CyberAmbassadors training regularly available
at academic and research institutions nationwide.</p></div>
